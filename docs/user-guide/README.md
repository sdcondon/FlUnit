# FlUnit User Guide

Admittedly fairly minimal so far. Note that the XML documentation published in the package itself is pretty decent (even if I do say so myself..). But here's some more information:

* **[Test Run Configuration](./test-run-configuration.md):** What aspects of test execution can be configured, and how to accomplish this
* **[Useful Patterns](./useful-patterns.md):** A few patterns that may prove useful when writing FlUnit tests
* **[Other Notes](./other-notes.md):** Assorted notes regarding the design of FlUnit and its usage
