# FlUnit User Guide

FlUnit's user guide is admittedly fairly minimal so far. Note that the XML documentation published in the package itself is pretty decent (even if I do say so myself..). But here's some more information:

* **[Getting Started](./getting-started.md):** Instructions for getting started with FlUnit.
* **[Useful Patterns](./useful-patterns.md):** A few patterns that may prove useful when writing FlUnit tests
* **[Advanced Functionality](./docs/user-guide/advanced-functionality.md):** Details of functionality not covered in "getting started"
* **[Other Notes](./other-notes.md):** Assorted notes regarding the design of FlUnit and its usage
