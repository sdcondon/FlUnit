# FlUnit

[![NuGet version (FlUnit)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/FlUnit.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FlUnit/) [![NuGet downloads (FlUnit)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/FlUnit.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FlUnit/)

This repo contains the source code for the FlUnit NuGet package.

## Package Documentation

For documentation of the package itself, see https://sdcondon.net/FlUnit/.

## Developer Documentation

I've not bothered writing up any documentation for developers - and likely won't until someone else expresses an interest in contributing.
I use Visual Studio, and once cloned, it should "just work" as far as compiling is concerned.
There are no esoteric third-party dependencies here, and aside from [T4](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/code-generation-and-t4-text-templates?view=vs-2022#design-time-t4-text-templates), no particularly unusual aspects of the solution.

## Issues and Contributions

I'm not expecting anyone to want to get involved given the relatively low download figures on NuGet, but please feel free to do so.
I do keep a vague eye on the issues tab, and will add a CONTRIBUTING.md if anyone drops me a message expressing interest.
