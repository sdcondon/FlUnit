This repo contains the source code for the FlUnit NuGet package.

## Package Documentation

## Issues and Contributions

I'm not expecting anyone to want to get involved given the relatively low download figures on NuGet, but please feel free to do so.
I do keep a vague eye on the issues tab, and will add a CONTRIBUTING.md if anyone drops me a message expressing interest.
